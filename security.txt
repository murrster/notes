Domain Fronting - technique leveraged by threat actors to use high reputation domains to disguise C2 callbacks/traffic from both the user and security tool sets. Needs to have a good domain. Org hosting malware will blacklist domain. Allows attack to bypass DNS whitelisting / blacklisting. As soon as EDR finds out that evil.com is hosting malware it's going to blacklist it. Will craft the malware sample in a way that it's going to send a request to nytimes.com but host data will point to evil.com. Attacker can bypass DNS blacklisting/whitelisting.

Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names on a single server. This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processer cycles, without requiring all services provided to sue the same host name.

Privacy data. Ensure web traffic is hidden/anonomized form the portions of the network when passing through restricted domains.

Priviledge Escalation

Lateral Movement - CS provides 3 strategies for executing beacons/code/commands on remote targets:
1) jump: [method][target][listener] psexec64/winrm64
2) remote-exec: [method][target][command] psexec/winrm
3) powershell --> execute-assembly C:\Seatbelt.exe OSInfo -ComputerName=web  

Windows Remote Management - SMB Beacon is excellent choice when moving laterally; SMB protocol used extensively in Windows env, traffic blends in very well

psexec/psexe64 cmds work by uploading a service binary to the target system, then creating and starting a Windows service to execute that binary. Beacons executed this way run as SYSTEM.

psexec_psh executes a PowerShell one-liner: jump psexec_psh web smb
