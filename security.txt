Domain Fronting - technique leveraged by threat actors to use high reputation domains to disguise C2 callbacks/traffic from both the user and security tool sets. Needs to have a good domain. Org hosting malware will blacklist domain. Allows attack to bypass DNS whitelisting / blacklisting. As soon as EDR finds out that evil.com is hosting malware it's going to blacklist it. Will craft the malware sample in a way that it's going to send a request to nytimes.com but host data will point to evil.com. Attacker can bypass DNS blacklisting/whitelisting.

Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names on a single server. This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processer cycles, without requiring all services provided to sue the same host name.
